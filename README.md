**`VideoGame Developer`**

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an indie videogame developer and student at Arizona State University focused on designing and implementing immersive, engaging and player-focused experiences. My projects often start with rough ideas and are built from the ground up, from planning and designing, all the way to creating and releasing experiences I wish to share with others. I enjoy tackling complex coding challenges and learning how to utilize a variety of tools to accomplish my digital goals. I am currently focused on developing a first person arena style shooter called Iron Duel alongside my friend and co-lead John Bostater. I publish devlog content surrounding the game's development to my YouTube channel "tzontius".

## Languages and Tools ðŸ“¢ 
Unity, GameMaker, C#, C++, Java, C, Javascript
